This is highly experimental! As in, nowhere near stable or usable.

Requirements: OpenCV and TKinter. Python. I just used whatever the ubuntu repositories had.

Usage: for now you will need to modify {{{ui.py}}} to use the video capture device of your choosing.

Run ui.py and use the tkinter UI (or press C with the image window focused) to enter crop mode.  Click and drag a rectangle around the characters to read.  Ensure that the characters take up nearly all of the height of the frame.

TODO
 * better decimal detection
 * better image filtering 
 * support negative numbers
 * output data to STDOUT, errors to STDERR
